Hello there. It is a simple project created using react. It is a simple that returns "This is matching" when all the three emojis are matched. If one of them is not matching it returns "This is not matching".

I have used emojis for this project.

For using emoji in vs code there is an extention called :emojisense first you have to install it and play with it as you want.

In this project I have used javascript object Destructuring.

Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, and maps and set them into new, distinct variables. Destructuring allows us to extract multiple properties, or items, from an arrayâ€‹ at a time.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
